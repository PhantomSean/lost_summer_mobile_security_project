## General info
The financial and logistical impact of COVID mean there are fewer internships available this year, and some companies have even had to withdraw earlier offers. The impact of this “lost summer” will be significant: those missing out in 2020 will be at a serious disadvantage when they enter the market. The harm could last years, since their CVs will be weaker, their networks smaller, their skills less sharp.
 
The Lost Summer Bootcamp will address the harm of lost internships in 2020.
 
A group of companies and individual volunteers will run a multi-week cyber security bootcamp this summer, providing many of the same benefits as an internship. Participants will work on practical challenges which stretch their technical skills and round out soft skills.
 
As part of the boot camp there will be a 4 week long project focused on **Secure development**. This repository with serve as the main landing page and documentation location for that project.
 
Secure development is a practice to ensure that the code and processes that go into developing applications are as secure as possible. Secure development entails the utilization of several processes, including the implementation of a **Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)** and secure coding itself.
 
To that end students of the course undertaking this project will partake in a project that is focused on SDL best practices using open source tools and github version control to learn how to build application securely and inline with industry best practices.
 
This project is expected to take 4 week approx.
